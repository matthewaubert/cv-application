# CV Application

This project was built as part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application">The Odin Project: React course</a> in order to practice what I've learned thus far about React, including project setup using Vite, components, JSX, keys, props, and state.

## Understanding the Problem

Create a small CV application.

Include the following sections in the CV:
- A section to add general information like name, email and phone number
- A section to add educational experience (school name, title of study, and date of study)
- A section to add practical experience (company name, position title, main responsibilities of my jobs, date from and until when I worked for that company)

Include an edit and submit button for each section or for the entire CV:
- The submit button should submit my form and display the value of my input fields in HTML elements
- The edit button should add back (display) the input fields, with the previously displayed information as values. In those input fields, I should be able to edit and resubmit the content.
- (Hint: I'm going to make heavy use of state and props)

## Plan

1. <a href="https://gist.github.com/matthewaubert/e809ae8ccfe41442bb588b3c49d9c63d">Create a new React project</a>

1. Think about how to structure my application into components

1. Create a `components` directory under my `src` directory for my components

1. Create a `styles` directory under my `src` directory for my CSS files. I'll need to import these in the component files to use them.

1. Push the project to Github and deploy using a PaaS (Platform as a Service)
